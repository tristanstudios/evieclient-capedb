# Welcome to the EvieClient Cape Repo!

### What is this?

This repo is for our [netlify site](https://evieapi.netlify.app/) to host a site for our Minecraft SMP Client "EvieClient" a place to read images.

### What is Evie Client?

Evie Client is a small project I'm working on and will probably be released in the distant future.

### Is the Client Open Source?

Not at the moment, idk if it will ever be but atm it's a private repo on my main github.

### Goals

 - [x] Pull cape designs via UUID's
 - [ ] Make a webapp or somesort of API to manage the repo, so I can type a UUID in and choose a cape image for it to rename the cape image to the UUID and put it in the UUID folder on the repo
